## What is GitHub Copilot?

- AI-powered paired programming assistant
- Developed by GitHub and OpenAI
- Uses machine learning models to suggest code snippets

---

## How GitHub Copilot works

- Uses OpenAI Codex model
- Analyzes context and patterns in codebase
- Suggests relevant code snippets when you type

---

## Benefits of using GitHub Copilot

- Faster coding
- Improved accuracy
- Learning tool
- Less time writing the simple stuff

---

## Potential limitations of GitHub Copilot
We are constantly evaluating and improving Copilot including our vision of where you can improve the whole development cycle with our vision Copilot X.

- Limited language support
- Code quality process still required
- May not compile

<!-- It doesn't replace
- Your unit tests
- Your security tooling
- Your code review process
- Your code quality tooling
- Functional tests
-->

---

## Future of GitHub Copilot

- Expanding language support
- Improving performance
- Becoming an essential tool for developers
- More than just code suggestions, but a full development assistant

---

## Conclusion

- GitHub Copilot can save significant time and effort for developers
- It has some limitations that need to be considered
- As machine learning models improve, Copilot's usefulness will only increase
